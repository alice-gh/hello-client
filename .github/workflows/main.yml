    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: set name var 1
        run: echo "my_version=LATEST" >> $GITHUB_ENV
      - name: set name var 2
        run: |
          echo "my_version: $my_version"
